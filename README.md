# Income_predictor-project

Income predictor is a part of my learning projects. I develop a simple logistic regression model and serve it on a web application. I use FLASK as a python web framework along with HTML/CSS to get a nice web structure and cool interface. I have added the payment system for the web app. Income predictor requires some input (as features) from users and predict their income (a binary feedback).
